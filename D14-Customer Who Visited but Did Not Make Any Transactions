# Solution to find the IDs of the users who visited without making any transactions and the number of times they made these types of visits.

DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS `User_Transactions`;
CREATE DATABASE `User_Transactions`;
USE `User_Transactions`;

CREATE TABLE visits (
visit_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
customer_id INT
);

CREATE TABLE transactions (
transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
visit_id INT,
amount INT
);

INSERT INTO visits (visit_id, customer_id)
VALUES
(1, 23),
(2, 9),
(4, 30),
(5, 54),
(6, 96),
(7, 54),
(8, 54);

INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_id, visit_id, amount)
VALUES
(2, 5, 310),
(3, 5, 300),
(9, 5, 200),
(12, 1, 910),
(13, 2, 970);

SELECT customer_id, COUNT(V.visit_id) AS count_no_trans 
FROM visits AS V
LEFT JOIN transactions AS T ON V.visit_id = T.visit_id
WHERE transaction_id IS NULL
GROUP BY customer_id;
